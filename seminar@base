        <blockquote><em>"According to me seminar is one of the most important classes at <strong>BASE</strong>. It is where most of my awesome memories are......."
            <strong>Eram, Grade 10;</strong>
        </em></blockquote>

        </em></blockquote>
        <p>Seminar is a social class at <strong>BASE</strong> where students check in the morning.Students also visit their seminar mid-day. The class size is usually 10-15 students.Students are able to express their feelings to their peers or talk about a problem whether it is academic or social. Students build their communication skills in seminar.</p>
        <h4>As a group we interviewed Lou (a new teacher at <strong>BASE</strong>) and Stephina (one of the founding members of <strong>BASE</strong>) to figure out the teacher's point of view on seminar.</h4>
        <h1>Here is Lou's response:</h1>
       <response> <p>What is your role in <strong>BASE</strong>?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"ELA teacher, Fitness Club moderator, and alongside Stephina, I coordinated seminars in October".</em></blockquote>
        <p>How can we (students/parents/teachers) contact you?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"Lou@bronxsoftware.org; I also rely on pigeons to carry mail. You can fly things to room 512."</em></blockquote>
        <p>How is your experiance in <strong>BASE</strong> till now?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"So far, my experience at <strong>BASE</strong> has been amazingly rewarding. My colleagues are a dynamic, open-minded group, and the students are a lively bunch, full of engaging questions and insights."</em></blockquote>
        <p>Does BASE have an impact in your life? If yes, then how?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"<strong>BASE</strong> is transforming my approaches to communication and listening. The Design Thinking framework, specifically empathizing and defining, informs my daily activities and the ways in which I interact with friends, family, colleagues, and students."</em></blockquote>
        <p>What is your opinion on circles(restorative justice)?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"Restorative Justice champions awareness and accountability, two mindsets that create thoughtful citizens. Restorative Justice develops a palpable sense of respect and reciprocity in the hallways and classrooms at <strong>BASE."</strong></em></blockquote>
        <p>What are some classroom norms that are important to you?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"My top two norms: one-mic and accountable talk. I love it when my class creates and leads a discussion."</em></blockquote>
        <p>According to you why is seminar important?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"Seminar sculpts and refines emotional and social intelligence. Simply, it's an invaluable experience. I wish I had an opportunity to take seminar when I was in high school."</em></blockquote>
        <h1>Stephina's Response!!!</h1>
        <p>What is your role in <strong>BASE?</strong></p>
        <blockquote><em>"My role is an educator of Social Studies, especially Global History, and Seminar Teacher. I serve as the Chapter Leader of the United Federation of Teachers, School Leadership Team, Vision Committee (Lou is also on vision), Innovations in Design Thinking Pilot, Digital Ready Curriculum Liaison, Peer Tutoring Liaison and Mastery-Based Grading Pilot."</em></blockquote>
        <p>How can we (students/parents/teachers) contact you?</p>
        <blockquote><em>Email: Stephina@bronxsoftware.org</em></blockquote>
        <p>How is your experiance in <strong>BASE</strong> till now?</p>
        <blockquote><em>"In my second year at <strong>BASE,</strong> I have seen growth in our staff and students. Step-by-step we are becoming the school we want to be at graduation. I am honored to continue working with the 10th grade students this year as they inspire me to always keep a positive attitude and find beauty even in tough situations."</em></blockquote>
       <p>Does <strong>BASE</strong> have an impact in your life? If yes, then how?</p>
       <blockquote><em>"When I came to <strong>BASE</strong>, I had already been teaching in the South Bronx for 5 years. Coming to <strong>BASE</strong> provided a huge opportunity for me to reflect on what it means to be an educator at a new school with a software engineering focus in the Bronx Borough of New York City. I am most impacted by how working with the young people at <strong>BASE</strong> challenges me to be clear about who I am and what I stand for, while also being clear about the fact that I don't have "all the answers": we create answers together through building trust and solidarity as a community. I believe in <strong>BASE</strong> students and what we are trying to do here, and I'm thankful to be spending many hours of my life with people who challenge me to become a dynamic person and a committed member of this community every day."</em></blockquote>
       <p>What is your opinion on circles(restorative justice)?</p>
       <blockquote><em>"My opinion is that we/humans/people/us tend to stick to our own opinions on the "he said/she said," so circles and restorative justice help us take a step back from our personal opinions and try to hear out or empathize with different perspectives. The point is NOT to always agree on "who is to blame" or "who is right or wrong"; the point is to realize that we all want respect (and love), and therefore we can avoid conflicts by talking about "triggers" and setting guidelines that outline what we need to feel respected and safe.
<br/>
Regardless of my opinion, evidence shows that restorative practices work when trying to resolve conflict or respond to "disciplinary issues." It's important that our community continues to practice circles when an injustice has occurred so that everyone who is impacted can be heard, and so that we can believe and trust in the process. Also it will be important that we begin to establish our own Peer Mediation council so that students can be a bigger part of our restorative practices at <strong>BASE!</strong>
"</em></blockquote>
      <p>According to you why is seminar important?</p>  
      <blockquote><em>"Seminar is most important because it is a space where we begin to build bonds as a community. In seminar, we are groups that belong to our <strong>BASE</strong> community: We put our voice into the student council, we share stories about our lives, we share with our Mentors, we celebrate birthdays and school celebrations, we learn and practice what it means to be a student at <strong>BASE.</strong> Seminar like the Core or heart of <strong>BASE</strong>."</em></blockquote>
