        <p>Seminar is a social class at <strong>BASE</strong> where students check in the morning.Students also visit their seminar mid-day. The class size is usually 10-15 students.Students are able to express their feelings to their peers or talk about a problem whether it is academic or social. Students build their communication skills in seminar.</p>
   <h4>As a group we interviewed Lou (a new teacher at <strong>BASE</strong>) and Stephina (one of the founding members of <strong>BASE</strong>) to figure out the teacher's point of view on seminar.</h4>

       <p>What is your opinion on circles(restorative justice)?</p>

        <blockquote><em>"My top two norms: one-mic and accountable talk. I love it when my class creates and leads a discussion."</em></blockquote>

        <h1>Stephina's Response!!!</h1>
         <p>What is your role in <strong>BASE?</strong></p>
        <blockquote><em>"My role is an educator of Social Studies, especially Global History, and Seminar Teacher. I serve as the Chapter Leader of the United Federation of Teachers, School Leadership Team, Vision Committee (Lou is also on vision), Innovations in Design Thinking Pilot, Digital Ready Curriculum Liaison, Peer Tutoring Liaison and Mastery-Based Grading pilot."</em></blockquote>
    
      <p>According to you why is seminar important?</p>  
      <blockquote><em>"Seminar is most important because it is a space where we begin to build bonds as a community. In seminar, we are groups that belong to our <strong>BASE</strong> community: We put our voice into the student council, we share stories about our lives, we share with our Mentors, we celebrate birthdays and school celebrations, we learn and practice what it means to be a student at <strong>BASE.</strong> Seminar like the Core or heart of <strong>BASE</strong>."</em></blockquote>     
        <p>What is your opinion on circles(restorative justice)?</p>
       <blockquote><em>"My opinion is that we/humans/people/us tend to stick to our own opinions on the "he said/she said," so circles and restorative justice help us take a step back from our personal opinions and try to hear out or empathize with different perspectives. The point is NOT to always agree on "who is to blame" or "who is right or wrong"; the point is to realize that we all want respect (and love), and therefore we can avoid conflicts by talking about "triggers" and setting guidelines that outline what we need to feel respected and safe.
<br/>
Regardless of my opinion, evidence shows that restorative practices work when trying to resolve conflict or respond to "disciplinary issues." It's important that our community continues to practice circles when an injustice has occurred so that everyone who is impacted can be heard, and so that we can believe and trust in the process. Also it will be important that we begin to establish our own Peer Mediation council so that students can be a bigger part of our restorative practices at <strong>BASE!</strong>
